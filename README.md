# OpenAI GPT-3 API [Deprecated]

**Please note that this project utilises the [completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions), which preceded the ChatGPT API. OpenAI has now deprecated the completion API.**

This project is a basic implementation of the GPT-3 completion API provided by OpenAI implemented in ReactJS. It is intended as a proof of concept for use in future projects and is not currently intended for use on its own. There are a number of features missing including robust error handling.

Also note that .env files are not a secure way of storing API keys in production; a proxy server should make requests using the API key.
